# Project: Habit Tracker Application
Habit Tracker program for my University course.

Habit Tracker.py is the main file. To run the program execute this file. Best to run it as a CLI because some functionality is not possible in IDLE.

functions.py file contains various functions that enable the program to work such as the different interactive interfaces, help features and database data management.

habit_class.py defines the Habit class and contains a few methods.

Currently, the program is in the middle stages of development. Most of the things are set and a few things need to be worked on.
