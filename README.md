# Project: Habit Tracker Application
Habit Tracker program for my University course.

Start here:

```Habit Tracker.py``` 

This is the main file that runs the program. Best to run it as a CLI because some functionality is not possible in IDLE.

```functions.py``` file contains various functions that enable the program to work such as the different interactive interfaces, help features and database data management.

```habit_class.py``` defines the Habit class and contains a few methods.

```analysis_module.py``` contains function to analyze habit streaks.

```test_program.py``` is used to test various functions of the program.

## Installation

```shell
python -r requirements.txt
```

The program is complete and fully developed.

## Tests

To test the program, you need to install ```pytest``` then in the project folder, run the following:
```shell
pytest test_program.py
```
