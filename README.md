# Project: Habit Tracker Application
Habit Tracker program for my University course.

Habit Tracker.py is the main file. To run the program execute this file. Best to run it as a CLI because some functionality is not possible in IDLE.

functions.py file contains various functions that enable the program to work such as the different interactive interfaces, help features and database data management.

habit class.py defines the Habit class and contains a few methods.

Right now, work is in progress. Many things are going to be added as well as removed. Basic structure is set but I would say that the program is still in early development stages.
